# Players Tracker

For the Under-18s soccer section, we had to record the players' attendance at every training session for at least 2 reasons:

- Player attendance, this reassures parents
- Number of players at each session, it helps us in our sessions

To simplify this process, we have created an application that will add each player present at the training session and transform it into a pdf file to be sent to management.
